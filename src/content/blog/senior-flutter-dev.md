We're looking for a Senior Flutter developer to lead frontend engineering.

### What you'll own
- Open source Flutter clients (mobile, web, desktop where applicable) with a focus on reliability and fast release cycles
- Underlying Dart open source libraries: [models](https://github.com/purplebase/models) and [purplebase](https://github.com/purplebase/purplebase), and help guide their direction
- Collaborate closely with [@franzap](https://npub.world/npub1wf4pufsucer5va8g9p0rj5dnhvfeh6d8w0g6eayaep5dhps6rsgs43dgh9) (product) and the backend/devops developer
- Meaningfully shape one of the most promising products in freedom tech – we have an exciting roadmap for 2026!

### You might be a fit if you
- Have designed, shipped, and maintained production Flutter apps (state management, offline caching, release tooling, etc.) for several years—open or closed source
- Most importantly, have strong taste for high-quality code—favoring signal over noise, simplicity over over-engineering
- Care about user sovereignty, Bitcoin, Nostr, and open protocols
- Know how and when to leverage AI agents for enhanced productivity
- Enjoy working with small teams, direct ownership, and writing the docs/tests that future contributors will lean on

### Nice to have
- An eye for UI and UX
- Open source contributions

### How we work
- Remote, async-friendly, minimal meetings

### Compensation
- Grants and community support currently keep us moving. We’re pursuing more funding from a variety of organizations and you can apply for grants too (OpenSats, HRF, others). Let’s chat and find a path that works.
- We're also developing commercial products so in the future—if all goes well—equity in the startup

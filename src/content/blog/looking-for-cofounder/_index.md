Rebuilding the internet we want for our kids is a tall order. [Nostr](https://nostr.com), the protocol with the highest chance to become the new substrate, is in its early adopter phase. With a relatively small addressable market, its success hinges on external funding.

Freedom-focused organizations like [HRF](https://hrf.org) and [OpenSats](https://opensats.org) have been providing grants to many Nostr-based projects, including Zapstore, for which I am incredibly grateful. These grants are perfect for the short to medium-term, they can be generous and have few strings attached. But they are typically designed to support a solo dev and provide limited runway that depends on a single source of income.

For most end-user products, however, the ideal situation is to be building a business that serves  paying customers. Not only there is a better incentive alignment, having the burning need to serve customers forces founders to break outside the bubble and seek wider market validation, which in turn exposes many more people to freedom tech.

[Primal](https://primal.net) and [Fountain](https://fountain.fm) are two interesting cases backed by venture capital. While traditionally that route can be problematic, in other words, influence over founders to grow at any cost, we are lucky to have a handful of value-aligned venture funds in the space.

My most pressing question today is how to make Zapstore grow sustainably as a business. (I was persuaded that by now I would have an army of AI bots that fixed all my problems. I am still waiting.)

It's challenging to focus on growth with no capital while simultaneously being dragged down by a failing server disk or coding the latest app feature. As much as I enjoy being a builder, I have a deep personal desire to add value from a higher level.

As AI dramatically changes the software production landscape and breaks the centralized app store model, Zapstore has figured out the optimal curation and distribution for the coming age – using permissionless money and reputation.

There are options and huge potential but I can't do it alone. I am officially looking for a technical co-founder who believes in the mission and has solid proof of work and references in the space. Ready to apply for a grant and take future equity. My inbox is open!

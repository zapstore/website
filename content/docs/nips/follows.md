Ðšind 3 defines follow lists, which allow social proof in Zapstore. For example, you might see three of your follows that also use a particular app.
This social proof is referred to as web-of-trust (WOT) within the context of Zapstore. 

Follow lists are defined by kind 3 in [NIP-02](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/02.md).

Zapstore also provides a web-of-trust data vending machine that returns WOT scores for apps!
